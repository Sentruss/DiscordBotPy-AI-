# DiscordBotPy-AI-
Discord Bot with AI made in Python (very old project)
So, this project was made on 2023 ending it's a AI Discord Bot which works on the api of ChatGPT and using the chatgpt3.5 turbo model of AI nowadays we can now see more and more powerful models which are paid so I thought I shouldn't buy it. I could've used deepseek also but no idea abt it's liscense and api so didn't insert your api key of openai and bot token
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
To chat with the bot you have to tag the bot '@botname' in the chat it has a one-chat memory so if u ask the bot anything it wil remember for only one chat duration still is has chances that it may remember life time it can even solve bugs!
<h3>NOTE</h3>
This BOT can increase it's knowledge and behaviour by you by upgrading the model so if u have any bug do contact me. This bot will not be online 24/7 u have to activate your code editor to activate it or open the editor 24/7
